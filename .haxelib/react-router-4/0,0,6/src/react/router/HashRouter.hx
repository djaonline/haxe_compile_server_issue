	A <Router> that uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e. window.location.hash)

	IMPORTANT NOTE: Hash history does not support location.key or location.state.
	In previous versions we attempted to shim the behavior but there were edge
	cases we couldn’t solve. Any code or plugin that needs this behavior won’t
	work. As this technique is only intended to support legacy browsers, we
	encourage you to configure your server to work with <BrowserHistory> instead.
